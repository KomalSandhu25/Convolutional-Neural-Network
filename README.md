# ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork

The code files for the given repo is private.

The repo includes implementation of Convolutional Neural Network from scratch (using Numpy) without using any inbuilt python libraries.

The dataset used is CIFAR-10 for image classification task.

The model involves building  2D convolution, 2D Max Pooling, ReLU, and Linear layers.

Added SGD optimizer with momentum term for faster convergence.
