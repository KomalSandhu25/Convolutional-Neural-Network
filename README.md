# ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork

The code files for the given repo is private.

The repo includes implementation of Convolutional Neural Network from scratch (using Numpy) without using any inbuilt python libraries.

The dataset used is CIFAR-10 for image classification task.

The model involves building  2D convolution, 2D Max Pooling, ReLU, and Linear layers. The idea here is to optimize the performance using multiple combination of these layers including batch normalization. The idea and the right orientation of model has been taken from other standard CNN models such as Alex Net, RestNet etc.

Added SGD optimizer with momentum term for faster convergence.
